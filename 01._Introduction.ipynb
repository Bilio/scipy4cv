    "In research and development (R&D), interactive computing environments are a frequently employed alternative for data exploration, algorithm development and prototyping. In the last twelve years, a popular scientific computing environment flourished around the Python programming language. Most of this environment is part of (or built over) a software stack named the SciPy Stack. Combined to the OpenCV’s Python interface, this environment becomes an alternative for current computer vision R&D. This tutorial introduces such an environment and shows how it can address different steps on computer vision research, from initial data exploration to parallel computing implementations. Several code examples are presented, addressing problems from simple image processing to inference by machine learning.\n",

    "Computer vision practitioners need a computing environment that lets them explore data like images, video sequences, point clouds and feature vectors. Such an environment should help on the development and testing of new models and algorithms, and on the deployment of the results, either as a final software module or a scientific/technical publication. It should also provides an *extensive* list of tools, routines for image processing, machine learning, statistical inference, linear algebra, convex optimization and graph algorithms, just to name a few. Problems involving large sets of images can require high-performance computing (HPC) such that the environment should provide practical ways to parallelize and distribute computation. An ideal environment should also combine documentation and computation in a single bundle, promoting results reproducibility, but preventing the research pipeline to become more cumbersome."
